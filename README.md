# Ultimes-Milites
The game is set directly after Varus' disaster in the Teutoburg Forest (9 A.D.)
Playing as a centurion who managed to create a ragtag century out of the survivors of the battle, you set out to return west across the
Rhine, into the safety of Roman land.  Of course, this is easier said than done.  You will encounter numerous hordes of angry Germanic 
tribes that you must defeat.
